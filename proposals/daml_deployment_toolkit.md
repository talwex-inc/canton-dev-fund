## Abstract

This proposal outlines a grant proposal to build a **Daml contract deployment framework**,distributed as a DPM component, similar to how Ethereum has Hardhat, Solana has Anchor and Sui has the Sui CLI. A single command-line tool that handles the full deployment workflow for Daml smart contracts: build, upload, party allocation, post-deploy scripting, and on-ledger verification.

Deploying a Daml package to a validator currently requires a developer to manually run `dpm build`, choose an upload path (Ledger API, JSON API, or Canton console depending on what the validator exposes), resolve auth tokens per environment, allocate parties via a separate API call, and run setup scripts manually and repeat all of this per network, with different flags and token sources each time.

**Daml Deployment Plugin** will close that gap. It is a DPM component, published to an OCI registry and installed via `dpm install package`, that registers a `dpm canton-deploy subcommand` and handles the full Daml deployment lifecycle to any Canton validator (LocalNet, DevNet, TestNet, or MainNet) from one config file with named per-network profiles.
Deployment component supports both the Admin API and Ledger API upload paths, is multi-synchronizer, integrates cleanly with DPM-built packages.

`canton-deploy` is implemented as a Node.js/TypeScript DPM component (Node.js 18+).

**Out of scope:** `damlc` remains the compiler, `daml-script` remains the script execution engine, DPM remains the package manager. This component is the deployment workflow layer that sits above them.

Total request: **220,000 CC (CC is at 0.096)** across three milestones over approximately one month.

---

## Specification

### 1. Objective

The primary objective for this proposal is to deliver a single, documented command-line maintained as open-source DPM Component that handles the full Daml deployment lifecycle on Canton which upload, vetting, party allocation, post-deploy scripting, usable across LocalNet, DevNet, TestNet, and MainNet validators with one consistent interface and no environment code changes by the developer.

### 2. Implementation Mechanics

The plugin is a DPM Component, Shipped and invoked as a DPM component (dpm canton-deploy ). Install follows the same pattern as other DPM components.

**Core architecture:**

The following must be present on your machine before using `Daml Deployment Plugin`:

| Dependency | Why it is needed | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **DPM** ≥ 1.0.14 | Host for the component; resolves and runs `dpm canton-deploy` | Bundled with Daml SDK 3.5+
| Node.js | Node.js ≥ 18 | Runtime for the canton-deploy component |
| **`damlc`** DPM component | Compiles your project to a `.dar` (via `dpm build`) | Installed via `dpm install package`
| **`daml-script`** DPM component | Runs post-deploy scripts (via `dpm script`) | Installed via `dpm install package`
| **A running Canton node** | Target for deploy — Ledger API and/or JSON API must be reachable from your machine | LocalNet via Docker Compose, or a managed validator |

### Two ways to upload a DAR

Canton exposes package upload through the Ledger/JSON API path and the Admin API path. The plugin supports both, and you can switch between them per-run or set a default in config.

| Path | API / service | Default port | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ledger` | `PackageManagementService.UploadDarFile` / JSON API `POST /v2/dars` | 5001 / 7575 | Works where only the Ledger API or JSON API is exposed. Recommended default for LocalNet / DevNet/ TestNet / MainNet. |
| `admin` | `PackageService.UploadDar` | 5002 | Operator-style tooling. Admin API must be reachable (may need VPN or port-forward). Not available on most managed validators. |

**Precedence:** `--upload-via` flag → `CANTON_DEPLOY_UPLOAD_VIA` env var → `uploadVia` in config → default `ledger`.

---

### Implementation Workflow

```bash
dpm canton-deploy deploy --network devnet --upload-via ledger
```
### 1. Pre-deployment Phase

- **Config Resolution:** Load `canton-deploy.config.js` → merge CLI flags → resolve env vars → validate schema
- **Authentication:** `--token` / `CANTON_DEPLOY_TOKEN` / `tokenCommand` / `tokenFile` / generate LocalNet HMAC token / use inline token
- **Connectivity Check:** Ping Ledger API, JSON API (and optionally Admin API) endpoints with auth headers. `deploy` runs this as a preflight check by default before upload.

### 2. Build Phase

- **DPM Integration:** DPM remains responsible for compilation. `canton-deploy` may invoke `dpm build` for a single-package project or `dpm build --all` for a multi-package project as a convenience; CI/CD may build first and use the resulting DARs directly.
- **Project Detection:** Prefer `multi-package.yaml` when present (including when invoked from a child package); otherwise read `daml.yaml`. The component resolves each package's DPM output rather than assuming that a dApp consists of one DAR.
- **Upload Set:** Project package outputs are filtered with `includePackages` / `excludePackages`, so test and local harness packages may be built but not uploaded. Downloaded or vendored production dependencies, such as Token Standard DARs, are supplied through `additionalDars` or repeatable `--dar` flags; `data-dependencies` are not uploaded implicitly.
- **Pre-built Operation:** `--skip-build` supports CI/CD and operator workflows where build artifacts have already been produced and verified.

### 3. Deployment Phase (Dual Upload Path)

- **API Selection Logic:** `--upload-via admin|ledger` → config `uploadVia` → env `CANTON_DEPLOY_UPLOAD_VIA` → default `ledger`
- **dApp Upload:** `deploy` uploads the resolved and filtered DAR set, with additional dependency DARs before project DARs.
- **Vetting Policy:** LocalNet vets on upload by default for development convenience. TestNet and MainNet default to upload-only. `--vet` / `--no-vet` override the network policy.
- **Explicit Vetting:** `vet` vets the same complete dApp DAR set resolved by `deploy`; `vet-dar <mainPackageId>` remains available for a single DAR. 
- **gRPC Channel Options:** Handle `grpc.default_authority` for Nginx virtual host routing
- **Error Handling and Automation:** Retry transient network failures and provide detailed auth/permission context. Exit code `0` means success and non-zero means failure; optional `--log-file` preserves output for CI artifacts.

### 4. Post-deployment Operations

- **Party Management:** Exposes `parties` (list known parties) and `allocate-party` (allocate by hint) via Ledger API `PartyManagementService`. existing parties are checked first and skipped if already present.
- **User Management:** Per-network `users` configuration creates users through Ledger API `UserManagementService.CreateUser` and grants `CanActAs` / `CanReadAs` rights for their configured parties.
- **Script Execution:** Invoke `dpm script` against live Canton participant (optional convenience wrapper via `run` / `deploy --script`)
- **Verification:** Query uploaded packages via Admin API `ListDars` or Ledger API `ListKnownPackages`

---

### Multi-Environment Operational Approach

### LocalNet

- **Authentication:** The Ledger API still uses JWT authentication. For supported LocalNet configurations, the component can generate a development-only HMAC token with the configured `unsafe` secret and user id; this is never used outside LocalNet.
- **Development defaults:** Ledger upload with vet-on-upload enabled, direct localhost HTTP/gRPC, and optional config-driven party/user onboarding.

### DevNet and TestNet

- **Authentication:** An explicit JWT is required via `--token`, `CANTON_DEPLOY_TOKEN`, `tokenFile`, or `tokenCommand`;
- **Upload strategy:** Prefer `ledger` API when Admin API requires VPN/port-forwarding
- **Synchronizer assignment:** Explicit `synchronizerId` configuration for multi-domain participants
- **Vetting:** Configurable on DevNet; off by default on TestNet, where an operator performs the explicit `vet` step.

### MainNet

- **Vault integration:** `tokenCommand: "vault kv get -field=token secret/mainnet-ledger"` (available for any network; Vault is just one example of a command that prints a JWT)
- **TLS termination:** Support for client certificates and custom CA trust stores
- **Controlled deployment:** Upload-only by default, explicit dApp-level vetting, production package allowlists, and operator-authorized user onboarding.
- **Audit logging:** Structured JSON output for deployment tracking

---

### Configuration

All settings live in `canton-deploy.config.js` at your project root. Multiple named networks are supported; use `--network` to select one.

| Key | What it controls |
|---|---|
| `host` | Validator host or IP address |
| `adminPort` | Admin gRPC API port (default 5002) |
| `ledgerPort` | Ledger gRPC API port (default 5001) |
| `httpPort` | HTTP JSON API port (default 7575) |
| `uploadVia` | `"admin"` or `"ledger"` — which API uploads the DAR (default `ledger`) |
| `token` / `tokenFile` / `tokenCommand` | JWT bearer token source |
| `tls` / `tlsCertFile` | Enable TLS and optional CA cert path |
| `synchronizerId` | Pin the target synchronizer (domain). **Required** when the participant is connected to more than one synchronizer. Omit only on single-synchronizer nodes where auto-detect is safe. |
| `vetOnUpload` | Vet during upload. Defaults on for LocalNet and off for TestNet/MainNet; override with `--vet` / `--no-vet`. |
| `additionalDars` | Downloaded or vendored DAR paths added to the project upload set |
| `includePackages` / `excludePackages` | Explicitly filter project packages resolved from `daml.yaml` / `multi-package.yaml` |
| `parties` / `users` | Per-network party allocation and user/right onboarding |

```js
// Developer running LocalNet
module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork: "localnet",
  networks: {
    localnet: {
      host: "localhost",
      adminPort: 5002,
      ledgerPort: 5001,
      httpPort: 7575,
      uploadVia: "ledger",
      vetOnUpload: true,
      excludePackages: ["./tests", "my-app-tests"],
      additionalDars: [
        // "./vendor/splice-api-token-standard.dar",
      ],
      users: [{
        userId: "ledger-api-user",
        parties: ["Alice", "Bob"],
        rights: ["CanActAs", "CanReadAs"],
      }],
    },
  },
};
```

```js
// MainNet production
module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork: "mainnet",
  networks: {
    mainnet: {
      host: "mainnet-validator.example.com",
      ledgerPort: 443,
      uploadVia: "ledger",
      tls: true,
      grpcAuthority: "grpc-ledger-api.example.com",
      synchronizerId: "global-domain::1220...",
      tokenCommand: "vault read -field=token secret/canton/mainnet-jwt",
      vetOnUpload: false,
      includePackages: ["./app", "./workflows"],
      excludePackages: ["./tests"],
      additionalDars: [
        "./vendor/splice-api-token-standard.dar",
      ],
      users: [{
        userId: "app-operator@clients",
        parties: ["AppOperator"],
        rights: ["CanActAs", "CanReadAs"],
      }],
    },
  },
};
```

Every port and the upload path can also be set via env vars: `CANTON_DEPLOY_ADMIN_PORT`, `CANTON_DEPLOY_LEDGER_PORT`, `CANTON_DEPLOY_HTTP_PORT`, `CANTON_DEPLOY_UPLOAD_VIA`, `CANTON_DEPLOY_TOKEN`.

### Deployment Lifecycles and Reference Use Cases

The component distinguishes three callers. A **developer** favors discovery, build convenience, LocalNet token generation, and optional automatic vetting. **CI/CD** is non-interactive, consumes pre-built artifacts with `--skip-build`, uses environment-provided credentials, stable exit codes and `--log-file`. A production **operator** uses TLS and an operator credential, uploads an allowlisted DAR set without auto-vetting, reviews it, and then runs an explicit vetting step.

1. **New developer with LocalNet:** From a directory containing `daml.yaml`, `deploy` runs `dpm build`, uploads the resulting DAR, vets it by default, and optionally ensures the configured parties/users and rights exist.
2. **Multi-package developer with LocalNet:** From a `multi-package.yaml` root (or a child package), `deploy` runs `dpm build --all`, resolves every project output, removes `excludePackages` such as test cases or setup scripts, adds `additionalDars`, and uploads/vets the resulting dApp set.
3. **Multiple DARs on MainNet:** CI first runs `dpm build --all`; the operator runs `deploy --skip-build --network mainnet`, which uploads the configured production allowlist and additional downloaded DARs without vetting. After review, `vet --network mainnet` explicitly vets it. User onboarding is a separate operator-authorized action.

---

### Supported Commands of Plugin

### `dpm canton-deploy`

The main workhorse. It resolves a single or multi-package project, optionally invokes DPM build, filters the project package set, adds downloaded/vendored DARs, and uploads the resulting dApp set. LocalNet may vet during upload; TestNet/MainNet use the explicit vet flow. It can also run the configured onboarding and post-deploy script steps.

```bash
dpm canton-deploy deploy --host localhost
dpm canton-deploy deploy --host localhost --upload-via ledger
dpm canton-deploy deploy --host 192.168.1.50 --token eyJhbG...
dpm canton-deploy deploy --network testnet --script My.Module:setup
dpm canton-deploy deploy --network mainnet --skip-build --dry-run
dpm canton-deploy deploy --dar ./vendor/token-standard.dar --network localnet
```

**Key flags:** `--upload-via admin|ledger`, repeatable `--dar`, `--skip-build`, `--vet` / `--no-vet`, `--dry-run`, `--script`, `--token`, `--log-file`, `--host`, `--ledger-port`, `--admin-port`, `--http-port`.

### `dpm canton-deploy vet` / `vet-dar`

`vet` resolves and vets the same complete dApp DAR set as `deploy`; `vet-dar <mainPackageId>` targets one DAR. 

```bash
dpm canton-deploy vet --network mainnet
dpm canton-deploy vet-dar <mainPackageId> --network mainnet
```

### `dpm canton-deploy dars`

Lists all DARs currently uploaded to a participant via the Admin API (`PackageService.ListDars`).

```bash
dpm canton-deploy dars --host localhost --admin-port 5002
dpm canton-deploy dars --host localhost --admin-port 2902  # Splice LocalNet app-user
```

### `dpm canton-deploy status`

Checks connectivity and auth against both the Admin API and Ledger API. Useful to confirm ports, token validity, and TLS settings before attempting a deploy.

```bash
dpm canton-deploy status --host localhost
```

### `dpm canton-deploy parties` / `allocate-party`

Lists known parties on the node, or allocates a new party by display name. Uses the Ledger API (`PartyManagementService`). The allocate flow checks existing parties first and allocates only if the party is not already present.

```bash
dpm canton-deploy parties --host localhost
dpm canton-deploy allocate-party "Alice" --host localhost
```

### `dpm canton-deploy users` / `create-user`

Lists participant users or creates a user and grants the configured rights for its parties through `UserManagementService`.

```bash
dpm canton-deploy users --network mainnet
dpm canton-deploy create-user --network mainnet --user-id app-operator@clients
```

### `dpm canton-deploy run`

Runs a Daml Script standalone (i.e. not as part of a deploy). Useful for seeding data or running test scenarios against a live node. Script output streams to stdout; optional `--log-file` captures command output/errors for CI artifacts.

```bash
dpm canton-deploy run My.Module:main --host localhost
```

### `dpm canton-deploy contracts`

Queries active contracts through the HTTP JSON API. Good for a quick app-level smoke check.

```bash
dpm canton-deploy contracts --host localhost --http-port 7575
```

### `dpm canton-deploy token`

Shows which JWT token is resolved for the current config/flags, and can decode it to inspect claims (`sub`, `aud`, expiry, time remaining).

```bash
dpm canton-deploy token --decode --host localhost
```

### `dpm canton-deploy packages`

Lists known packages (Daml package IDs) on the participant via the Ledger API (`PackageManagementService.ListKnownPackages`). Resolves package ID to name and version where available. Use this to verify a DAR upload succeeded when the Admin API is unavailable, or to check which package IDs are active.

```bash
dpm canton-deploy packages --host localhost --ledger-port 5001
```

### `dpm canton-deploy init`

Interactive wizard that generates a `canton-deploy.config.js` in your project root. Walks through: network name, host, ports, default upload path (admin vs ledger), TLS settings, and token source (inline / file / shell command / LocalNet auto).

```bash
dpm canton-deploy init
```

### 3. Architectural Alignment
This proposal aligns with Canton priorities because:

- According to canton network developer experience and tooling survey (2026), several mention of a development framework similar to hardhat was marked as the most critical need.
- Local Development Frameworks are the most urgent gap, rated “Critical” (the highest rating in any category), indicating this is a significant pain point.
- The work aligns with CIP-0082's named targets of "dev tools" and "critical infra" as common-good investments.

### 4. Backward Compatibility
No backward compatibility impact.

## Acceptance Criteria
The Tech & Ops Committee will evaluate completion based on:

- Deliverables completed as specified for each milestone.
- Demonstrated functionality: a committee member or delegate can install the plugin, follow the published documentation, and complete the milestone-specific reference flow end-to-end.
- Each milestone's documentation should be sufficient for an independent Canton developer to use the relevant features.

Project-specific acceptance conditions:

- All code released in a public GitHub repository before any milestone payment.
- OCI component release (Deployment framework at Milestone 2) and docs published.
- Canton SDK compatibility: both components will track the latest Canton SDK major within 60 days of any new release during the grant period.

## Funding

**Total Funding Request:**
Total 220,000 CC Canton Coin (CC is at 0.096) funding requested.

### Payment Breakdown by Milestone
- Milestone 1 _(Core Deployment component MVP on Localnet and Devnet)_: 50,000 CC upon committee acceptance
- Milestone 2 _(Launch Deployment component with Documentation, OCI Distribution)_: 50,000 CC upon committee acceptance
- Milestone 3 _(GTM and Ecosystem Adoption)_: 120,000 CC upon acceptance


### Volatility Stipulation
The grant duration is 1 month. The grant is valued at $20,000 USD. Funding will be disbursed in Canton Coin, with the CC amount for each milestone calculated using the prevailing USD/CC exchange rate at the time of that disbursement, so that the total value received across the grant equals $20,000 USD regardless of CC price movement during the funding period.

## Co-Marketing
Upon release, LYNC entity will collaborate with the Foundation on:

- Announcement coordination across Foundation and LYNC channels at each milestone.
- A technical blog post and video walking developers through the plugin — from `dpm install package` to a deploy Daml package on LocalNet, Devnet, TestNet, and MainNet.
- Documentation inclusion: Submission for inclusion in Canton's official documentation and developer onboarding channels, so new builders find the plugin.
- Co-marketing on X: Launch announcement coordinated across LYNC and Canton Foundation X accounts, with cross-amplification on major release.

## Motivation

Every Daml project that ships to a Canton goes through the same deployment workflow: build, upload, allocate parties, run setup. Each step exists in DPM today, but as separate commands invoked with separate flags against separately configured endpoints. 
There is no single tool that composes them into one config-driven workflow per network profile.

In the recent ecosystem survey, 41% of respondents cited environment setup and node operations as the task that took the longest to get right when they first started, a statistic that captures, in numbers. A deployment CLI shifts that wall from hours of trial-and-error to a few minutes of `dpm install package`.

Local Development Frameworks were rated the most urgent gap, the only category rated "Critical" in the prioritization matrix, with respondents naming Hardhat, Anchor, and similar CLIs. 71% of surveyed developers come from an Ethereum background and arrive expecting that shape of tooling as mentioned in the [recent survey analysis 2026](https://forum.canton.network/t/canton-network-developer-experience-and-tooling-survey-analysis-2026/8412).

When we started building on canton network, we faced the same problem and decided to solve this for everyone by building Daml Deployment Plugin.

---

## Rationale

**Why a Hardhat-style CLI specifically?**

The Hardhat / Foundry / Anchor / Sui-CLI pattern is the established development tool for smart-contract deployment across other major blockchains. The pattern is proven, and developers arriving from other ecosystems expect it.

As of now, No Canton tool covers the full deployment lifecycle. `dpm build` / `damlc` handles compilation only. DPM 3.5 removed `daml ledger upload-dar` and similar commands — upload, party allocation, and on-ledger package queries are now done via JSON/gRPC APIs or Canton console. The Canton console is an operator REPL, not a developer CLI. Daml Deployment Plugin unifies the post-build deployment workflow into one CLI with one config file.

**Why DPM components instead of npm packages?**

- Canton developers already run DPM, adding npm globals is friction the ecosystem does not need.
- Components declared in `daml.yaml` are pinned per project and tied to the SDK the project compiles against.
- Canton developers find first-party tooling through DPM components.

### Maintenance & Support
LYNC will provide maintenance and support for the Daml Deployment Toolkit for 6 months following final delivery. 
This covers bug fixes, compatibility updates, including maintaining Canton SDK compatibility within 60 days of new SDK releases, per the acceptance criteria and minor improvements based on Committee or community feedback. Beyond this initial 6-month window, continued maintenance and support will be scoped and proposed separately as a follow-on request, allowing the Committee to evaluate ongoing funding based on real-world adoption and usage during the maintenance period.
